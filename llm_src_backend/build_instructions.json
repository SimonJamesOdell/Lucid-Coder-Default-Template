    "Harness detects backend capability from LLM backend manifest before invoking backend-specific gates.",
    "During development, backend checks are invoked only for backend changes in fast mode; strict mode adds runtime/security tests.",
    "Parse manifest.json to discover all backend entities.",
    "Load llm_src/invariants.json as the canonical contract/invariant policy input.",
    "Load llm_src_backend/security.json as the canonical backend security policy.",
    "Validate endpoint schemas against shared frontend/backend contracts before backend output generation.",
    "Enforce explicit endpoint visibility flags (public:true/false) and secure-by-default JWT policy.",
    "Assemble endpoints, logic, models, and tests according to relationships.",
    "Generate backend runtime only in /backend_dist/server.cjs with policy-driven middleware.",
    "Generate backend_dist/manifest.generated.json with endpoint security metadata for drift checks.",
    "Run all embedded and global tests, validate outputs automatically.",
    "Run backend runtime smoke tests against generated server (health, signup, login, failure paths).",
    "If auth capability exists, run backend security tests (production guard + rate limiting).",
    "Output test results (pass/fail, details) in terminal after each build.",
    "Run release assurance gate (`npm run release:assure`) before deployment.",
    "Report test results and halt build if any test fails."
