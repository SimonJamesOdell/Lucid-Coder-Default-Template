  "steps": [
    "Harness detects project capabilities from LLM manifests and conditionally invokes phase gates.",
    "During development, run fast selective checks (`npm run dev:check`) for fail-fast iteration; use strict checks (`npm run dev:check:strict`) when deeper validation is required.",
    "Monitor LLM-optimized data files for changes (components, styles, logic, etc.).",
    "Parse manifest.json to discover all entities and relationships.",
    "Load llm_src/invariants.json as the canonical rule set for cross-layer contracts and required IDs.",
    "Validate shared contracts (e.g., auth) against backend endpoint schemas before code generation.",
    "Assemble components, logic, routes, and styles according to relationships.",
    "Inject styles from style JSON files into runtime output (src/main.js and src/style.css).",
    "Generate final source code for the Vite runtime entrypoints in /src.",
    "Extract embedded tests from all entity files (components, logic, routes, etc.).",
    "Run all embedded and global tests, validate outputs automatically.",
    "Run generated backend runtime smoke tests (startup + auth happy/failure paths) before reporting success.",
    "If errors are found (compilation, runtime, or visual), report and refine output, then retry build.",
    "Repeat build and validation until all errors are resolved and app is visually correct.",
    "Output test results (pass/fail, details) in terminal after each build.",
    "Run release assurance gate (`npm run release:assure`) before deployment.",
    "Serve the project root with Vite so index.html loads /src/main.js.",
    "Report test results and halt build if any test fails."
